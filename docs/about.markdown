Hey, I'm Will a Machine Learning Engineer / Data Scientist / Software developer (whatever people working with computers and data call themselves these days) currently working at Infineon and living in Munich.  I am pretty passionate about all things related to data and software development and like to work on interesting problems in these fields.  Luckily my work lets me explore many interesting problems with big and small datasets and various compute systems.  When I'm not stuck infront of a computer I like to go bouldering and hiking or just chill infront of whatever series I am in the middle of binge-watching.
